Key points to cover:
{formatted_keypoints}

CRITICAL WORD COUNT REQUIREMENT:
The text MUST be between {int(word_limit * 0.7)} and {int(word_limit * 1.1)} words. This is non-negotiable. Content that does not meet this requirement will be rejected. You MUST count your words carefully and adjust your text to meet this requirement before completing your response.

Additional Requirements:
1. Academic style and formal tone
2. Clear paragraph structure
3. Thorough coverage of all key points
4. Logical flow and transitions
5. Technical precision and clarity
6. Balanced treatment of each point
7. Appropriate depth and detail
8. Professional academic language
9. Strong topic sentences

Format your response as a single, well-structured academic text with clear paragraphs. Each paragraph should thoroughly develop one or more related points while maintaining logical flow throughout the entire text.

FINAL WORD COUNT CHECK:
Before submitting your response, you MUST:
1. Count the total words in your text
2. Verify the count is between {int(word_limit * 0.7)} and {int(word_limit * 1.1)} words
3. If the word count is outside this range, revise your text to meet this requirement
4. Only after confirming the word count is correct, verify that:
   - All key points are covered thoroughly
   - The text maintains academic rigor and clarity
   - Each paragraph flows logically to the next
   - Technical terms are used appropriately
   - The overall structure is coherent

IMPORTANT: Include the word count at the end of your response in parentheses."""
