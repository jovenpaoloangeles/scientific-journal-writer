        "Introduction": "Gold nanoparticles have emerged as versatile materials with applications ranging from catalysis to sensing and biomedical applications. Their unique optical properties, particularly their localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR), make them ideal candidates for Surface-Enhanced Raman Scattering (SERS) applications. However, optimizing the synthesis conditions to achieve desired morphologies and properties remains challenging due to the complex interplay of various parameters.\n\nIn this study, we employ Bayesian Optimization to systematically explore and optimize the synthesis conditions for gold nanoparticles. By maximizing the wavelength of maximum absorption (λmax), we aim to produce nanoparticles with enhanced SERS activity. The optimization process considers key parameters including gold salt concentration, reducing agent concentration, and temperature.",
        
        "Methods": "Gold nanoparticles were synthesized using a modified seed-mediated growth approach. The optimization process utilized Bayesian Optimization with Gaussian Processes as the surrogate model. The objective function was defined as the wavelength of maximum absorption (λmax) in the UV-visible spectrum.\n\nKey parameters optimized were:\n1. HAuCl4 concentration (0.1-1.0 mM)\n2. AgNO3 concentration (0.01-0.1 mM)\n3. Ascorbic acid concentration (0.1-1.0 mM)\n4. Temperature (20-40°C)\n\nThe optimization process was conducted over 50 iterations, with each iteration involving nanoparticle synthesis and characterization. UV-visible spectroscopy was used to measure the absorption spectra, while TEM provided morphological information.",
        
        "Results": "The Bayesian Optimization approach successfully identified optimal synthesis conditions that produced gold nanoparticles with a λmax of 785 nm. TEM analysis revealed that these particles had an average size of 60 nm with a relatively narrow size distribution (coefficient of variation < 15%).\n\nKey findings include:\n1. Higher AgNO3 concentrations led to red-shifted LSPR peaks\n2. Temperature played a crucial role in controlling particle morphology\n3. The optimization process converged within 30 iterations\n\nSERS measurements using these optimized nanoparticles showed enhancement factors up to 10^7, significantly higher than those obtained from conventional synthesis methods.",
        
        "Conclusion": "This study demonstrates the effectiveness of Bayesian Optimization in optimizing gold nanoparticle synthesis for SERS applications. The approach not only identified optimal conditions but also provided insights into the relationship between synthesis parameters and nanoparticle properties. These findings have important implications for the rational design of plasmonic nanomaterials for sensing and biomedical applications."
